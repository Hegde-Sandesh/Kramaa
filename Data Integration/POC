12v power supply

Working:

Arduino is used for controlling whole the process with a GPS Receiver and GSM module. 
GSM module will require a 4G SIM card. GPS Receiver is used for detecting coordinates of the vehicle. 
GSM module is used for sending the real time location of user. 
The data will be sent to IOT platform and from that platform the location coordinates will be retrieved on Mobile App. 
The coordinates will be fetched to Google Map on mobile. The mobile App will have Login to have secured platform. 
Accelerometer is used for detecting accident or sudden change in any axis. 
If a sudden change in accelerometer data is detected, then an alert SMS will be sent to provided Mobile Number. 
In this manner several vehicles will be able to monitor from a single mobile App. 
We will use Kramaa IOT Platform which will act as a broker. 
As per the industry requirement of now, MQTT is the appropriate protocol for data transfer. 
Hence we will use MQTT protocol and to make it more secure we may use SSL
